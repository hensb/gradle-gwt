================

This is a simple template project layout for a **Java web-application** using **Google WebToolkit**.  

The *compileGWT* task was taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/gpike/3722887 "Gradle build file for GWT")  

Relevant build commands for the *gradle script* are

* `gradle clean -i` - will clean previous builds
* `gradle cleanEclipse -i` - scrub eclipse project layout
* `gradle eclipse -i` - generate eclipse project files
* `gradle war -i` - generate war-file 
* `gradle jettyRunWar -i` - generate war-file and host it locally
